The goal is to create a simple program that allows you to select an image (.pdf) and it will create a text file with the contents.



###Folder Breakdown
- lib - short for library, holds java classes created by other people
- out - when compiling, the files go here, no need to touch
- src - short for source, main folder where all our code goes
- tessdata - files for the tesseract OCR engine, no need to touch
- images - the program dumps the image files here when converting pdf's
